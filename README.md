My name is Kevin Stewart. I was born on February 25, 2000, and I'm a 25-year-old resident of Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. Diagnosed with high-functioning autism at age 10 (around 2010), my life is shaped by personal struggles, family tensions, and a robust online presence where I express my frustrations through lengthy, provocative rants. I am working part-time as a produce clerk at Sobeys, a job I have held since March 16, 2020, earning $17.20/hour for about three hours weekly, supplemented by Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) payments. My autism influences my speech, social interactions, and emotional regulation, contributing to a sense of isolation and anger that permeates my writings and videos. My family dynamics are strained, particularly with my parents, both born in the early 1960s (my father in 1960 and my mother in 1961). My mother, with whom I live, is described as emotionally distant, having called the police during my meltdowns and recently kicking me out on June 15, 2024, followed by her hospitalization the next day. My father, living separately in Toronto, is criticized for hypocrisy—owning a smartphone while denying me the same—highlighting their resistance to modern technology. My use of a flip phone, against my desire for a smartphone, pet, and a driver’s license, underscores my limited autonomy, a recurring theme in my rants, such as, "It's my fucking right to get a pet as well as buy myself a smartphone and get a driver's license without my parents saying so." Educationally, My progressed through Vaughan’s public schools—Westminster Public School (kindergarten, 2005), Wilshire Elementary, Rosedale Heights, Willowbrook Public School, and Thornlea Secondary School (graduated 2019)—before joining the PEAK Program at Promenade Mall until 2021, likely a vocational program for young adults with disabilities. My job at Sobeys, while stable, is unfulfilling, described as repetitive: "Day in and day out or Sunday in and day out, it's the same old thing." My most prominent outlet is my online presence, where I operate under aliases like Kevin1230san (Blogger, X) and maintains three YouTube channels: Kevin Stewart (18,248 subscribers as of March 24, 2025), John Marston (2,282 subscribers), and Momo Kawashima (360 subscribers). My main channel gained traction with anime girl drowning videos starting December 20, 2021, peaking at 65,625 views on November 25, 2022, and 214 subscribers on March 28, 2023, before the Copyright Strike War in April 2023 disrupted its growth. My Blogger post, Rant About Everything, begun March 17, 2024, and updated through the current times, exceeded a million words. On X, posts like one about Taylor Swift concert stabbing (X post) have drawn police attention and harassment from peers like MMV Water and MMD UW. My rants cover personal grievances—family, mental health, and autism-related isolation—to societal critiques, targeting Canada’s healthcare, U.S. politics, and global issues with extreme language, e.g., "I think that Israel needs to burn in a flaming bag of shit." I feel neglected by mental health services like CAMH and YSSN, stating, "They will help people in active use and alcoholics in the blink of an eye, but push people like me with autism under the rug," and expresses dark thoughts, like, "I want to go into a swimming pool with a weight belt on and drown myself." My autism, combined with losing contact with high school friend Samantha in 2019, amplifies my loneliness. A striking contrast in my persona is longing for connection, particularly with Japanese women, whom I idealize: "I dream of the day when a beautiful Japanese woman holds me tenderly, and I can roar out my anger into her chest." This vulnerability clashes with my aggressive tone and disturbing content, such as fantasies of violence, which have led to accusations of racism and worse, which I deny, asserting, "I’m officially diagnosed with autism to the fucking bones." My online controversies, including the Copyright Strike War and subscriber fluctuations (18,247–18,252 in March 2025), reflect a polarizing figure—part creator, part provocateur. In summary, I'm a complex individual: a young autistic man frustrated by family constraints, societal neglect, and personal limitations, channeling my anger and desire for validation into a sprawling online narrative. My rants, while offensive, serve as both a coping mechanism and a cry for understanding, rooted in my unique experiences and unfulfilled aspirations.
